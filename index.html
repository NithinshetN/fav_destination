                <p> Jomlu Theertha is a small scenic waterfalls + River spot 12 kms from Hebri town in coastal
                    Karnataka's Udupi district. However this waterfall remains closed for most of the year for reasons
                    best known to authorities. Jomlu Theertha is formed by River Seetha flowing over large boulders and
                    dropping for about 20 feet at some spots. Since the Jomlu falls is located within Someshwara
                    Wildlife Sanctuary limits, entry is controlled by Forest Department.</p>
